# Stripe submenus

[Inspiration](https://stripe.com/)

- useGlobalContext - custom useContextHook for sending data through whole app
- sending states, functions to other components
- open/close sidebar when it is on smaller screen
- retrieve sub-links in sidebar on smaller screen
- display/hide submenu
- change location of submenu based on hovered menu item
- retrieve items for each menu button
- change width of the submenu container based on links count
